Hints for the konami code

1. Create a list of all the keycodes you are looking for for the konami code.
2. Create an event listener to catch every key pressed, maybe creating a counter is a good idea, increase the value +1 everytime you type something.
3. Check if the key that was pressed it's the next one in the list.
4. And if the length of the list is the same as a counter that means you got it!
5. Maybe it's a good idea to reset everything either if i got it or not.
