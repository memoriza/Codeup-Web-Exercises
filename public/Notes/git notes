git notes
`git branch` shows you the branches you have locally
`git branch my-new-branch` creates a new local branch called my-new-branch
`git checkout my-new-branch` moves you to the my-new-branch branch
`git push -u origin my-new-branch` to tell GitHub about your new branch
`git push origin my-new-branch` for all future pushes to that new branch

Once you've merged code from a new branch into master,
GitHub's master branch has that code
but your local master branch doesn't.

`git checkout master`
`git pull origin master` (to get the new content from github's master)
@ this point, your local master will have the merged changes

this is called "bringing master up to date"
