=================================INTRO TO MYSQL

   Database Advantages
       A safe, reliable, fast, and convenient way to persist massive amounts of data to be used and updated by multiple users and applications.

       The world runs on databases...


   
   Data Model
       A way data is stored. MySQL organizes data in a relational model.



   Relational Model
       A data model where data is organized into relations (tables) that are very similar to spreadsheets. (see diagram)

       It is the most widely used data model used among Database Management Systems.

       A DMS that uses a relational model is known as a Relational Database Management System.



   RDBMS
       - A piece of software to organize and manage a database using the relational model



   MySQL
       - Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
       - Free
       - Open source
       - Widely used by small companies and some enterprise market share
       


   SQL "Structured Query Language"
       - A "declarative" language to tell the RDBMS what you want without telling it how to do it.
       (see example)



   SQL exercise resources (careful about different dialects of SQL):

   Subsets of SQL to explore we will explore in the coming lessons:

       DDL "Data Definition Language" - SQL syntax to create and manipulate databases and tables
       DCL "Data Control Language" - SQL syntax to create and manipulate users and user access
       DML "Data Manipulation Language" - SQL syntax to create, update and delete data in a database
       DQL "Data Query Language" - SQL syntax to search for specific data in a database


=================================MySQL ClIENT and EXERCISE

MySQL client - much like a PHP REPL for communicating with a MySQL server.



Logging in...

   From inside your Vagrant environment:
       1) type "mysql -u vagrant -p"
       2) press enter
       3) type "vagrant" as your password
       4) press enter



Help menu...

   At any time, access the help menu by typing "help".
   See a help menu of topics by typing "help contents"



Exit MySQL client...

   Type "exit" to exit the client.



Format client output...

   Most SQL commands end with a semicolon " ; ".

   To see results formatted in a different way, end the query with " \G "
